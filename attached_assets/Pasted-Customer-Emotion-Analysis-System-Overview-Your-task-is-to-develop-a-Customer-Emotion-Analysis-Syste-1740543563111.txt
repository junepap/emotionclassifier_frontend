Customer Emotion Analysis System​
Overview
Your task is to develop a Customer Emotion Analysis System that processes customer
feedback to:
●​ Extract emotions and assess their intensity.
●​ Identify topics and subtopics within the feedback.
●​ Calculate an engagement score (Adorescore) to measure overall sentiment.
This system will enable businesses to better understand customer sentiment and take
actionable steps to improve their services.
Core Requirements
1. Emotion Detection Engine
Develop a system capable of:
●​●​●​●​●​Identifying and classifying emotions across three activation levels (High, Medium,
Low).
Mapping customer text to emotional states (e.g., Joy, Serenity, Ecstasy).
Calculating emotional intensity scores for each feedback instance.
Handling multiple emotions within a single piece of feedback.
Providing confidence scores for emotion classifications.
2. Topic Analysis System
Implement a mechanism that:
●​●​●​●​●​Extracts main topics from feedback (e.g., Delivery, Quality, Clothes).
Identifies subtopics within those main topics (e.g., Fast Delivery, Quick Delivery, Free
Delivery).
Ensures consistent topic/subtopic categorization across feedback.
Maintains a topic hierarchy and captures relationships.
Provides topic relevance scores to measure importance.
3. Adorescore Calculation
Develop a scoring system that:
●​
●​
●​
●​
●​
Computes an overall sentiment score (Adorescore) ranging from -100 to +100.
Weighs different emotional factors to derive a balanced score.
Incorporates topic relevance in the scoring calculation.
Provides score breakdowns by topic for deeper insights.
Tracks sentiment trends over time to measure progress.
4. Analysis Integration
Ensure seamless integration between components:
●​
●​
●​
●​
●​
Connect emotion detection with topic analysis.
Map emotions to specific topics and subtopics.
Generate theme-emotion correlation metrics.
Calculate per-topic emotional distributions.
Provide aggregated insights across dimensions.
